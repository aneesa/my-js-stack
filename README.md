# 01 - Node, Yarn, and `package.json`

Code for this chapter available [here](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-walkthrough/tree/master/01-node-yarn-package-json).

In this section we will set up Node, Yarn, a basic `package.json` file, and try a package.

## Node

> üí° **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** is a JavaScript runtime environment. It is mostly used for Back-End development, but also for general scripting. In the context of Front-End development, it can be used to perform a whole bunch of tasks like linting, testing, and assembling files.

We will use Node for basically everything in this tutorial, so you're going to need it. Head to the [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) for **macOS** or **Windows** binaries, or the [package manager installations page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for Linux distributions.

For instance, on **Ubuntu / Debian**, you would run the following commands to install Node:

```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

You want any version of Node > 6.5.0.

## Node Version Management Tools

If you need the flexibility to use multiple versions of Node, check out [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n).

## NPM

NPM is the default package manager for Node. It is automatically installed alongside with Node. Package managers are used to install and manage packages (modules of code that you or someone else wrote). We are going to use a lot of packages in this tutorial, but we'll use Yarn, another package manager.

## Yarn

> üí° **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)** is a Node.js package manager which is much faster than NPM, has offline support, and fetches dependencies [more predictably](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/yarn-lock).

Since it [came out](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360) in October 2016, it received a very quick adoption and may soon become the package manager of choice of the JavaScript community. If you want to stick to NPM you can simply replace all `yarn add` and `yarn add --dev` commands of this tutorial by `npm install --save` and `npm install --save-dev`.

Install Yarn by following the [instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for your OS. I would recommend using the **Installation Script** from the *Alternatives* tab if you are on macOS or Unix, to [avoid](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1505) relying on other package managers:

```sh
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

## `package.json`

> üí° **[package.json](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json)** is the file used to describe and configure your JavaScript project. It contains general information (your project name, version, contributors, license, etc), configuration options for tools you use, and even a section to run *tasks*.

- Create a new folder to work in, and `cd` in it.
- Run `yarn init` and answer the questions (`yarn init -y` to skip all questions), to generate a `package.json` file automatically.

Here is the basic `package.json` I'll use in this tutorial:

```json
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

## Hello World

- Create an `index.js` file containing `console.log('Hello world')`

üèÅ Run `node .` in this folder (`index.js` is the default file Node looks for in a folder). It should print "Hello world".

**Note**: See that üèÅ racing flag emoji? I will use it every time you reach a **checkpoint**. We are sometimes going to make a lot of changes in a row, and your code may not work until you reach the next checkpoint.

## `start` script

Running `node .` to execute our program is a bit too low-level. We are going to use an NPM/Yarn script to trigger the execution of that code instead. That will give us a nice abstraction to be able to always use `yarn start`, even when our program gets more complicated.

- In `package.json`, add a `scripts` object like so:

```json
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ."
  }
}
```

`start` is the name we give to the *task* that will run our program. We are going to create a lot of different tasks in this `scripts` object throughout this tutorial. `start` is typically the name given to the default task of an application. Some other standard task names are `stop` and `test`.

`package.json` must be a valid JSON file, which means that you cannot have trailing commas. So be careful when editing manually your `package.json` file.

üèÅ Run `yarn start`. It should print `Hello world`.

## Git and `.gitignore`

- Initialize a Git repository with `git init`

- Create a `.gitignore` file and add the following to it:

```gitignore
.DS_Store
/*.log
```

`.DS_Store` files are auto-generated macOS files that you should never have in your repository.

`npm-debug.log` and `yarn-error.log` are files that are created when your package manager encounters an error, we don't want them versioned in our repository.

## Installing and using a package

In this section we will install and use a package. A "package" is simply a piece of code that someone else wrote, and that you can use in your own code. It can be anything. Here, we're going to try a package that helps you manipulate colors for instance.

- Install the community-made package called `color` by running `yarn add color`

Open `package.json` to see how Yarn automatically added `color` in  `dependencies`.

A `node_modules` folder has been created to store the package.

- Add `node_modules/` to your `.gitignore`

You will also notice that a `yarn.lock` file got generated by Yarn. You should commit this file to your repository, as it will ensure that everyone in your team uses the same version of your packages. If you're sticking to NPM instead of Yarn, the equivalent of this file is the *shrinkwrap*.

- Write the following to your `index.js` file:

```js
const color = require('color')

const redHexa = color({ r: 255, g: 0, b: 0 }).hex()

console.log(redHexa)
```

üèÅ Run `yarn start`. It should print `#FF0000`.

Congratulations, you installed and used a package!

`color` is just used in this section to teach you how to use a simple package. We won't need it anymore, so you can uninstall it:

- Run `yarn remove color`

## Two kinds of dependencies

There are two kinds of package dependencies, `"dependencies"` and `"devDependencies"`:

**Dependencies** are libraries you need for your application to function (React, Redux, Lodash, jQuery, etc). You install them with `yarn add [package]`.

**Dev Dependencies** are libraries used during development or to build your application (Webpack, SASS, linters, testing frameworks, etc). You install those with `yarn add --dev [package]`.

Next section: [02 - Babel, ES6, ESLint, Flow, Jest, Husky](02-babel-es6-eslint-flow-jest-husky.md#readme)

Back to the [table of contents](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch#table-of-contents).

# 02 - Babel, ES6, ESLint, Flow, Jest, and Husky

Code for this chapter available [here](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-walkthrough/tree/master/02-babel-es6-eslint-flow-jest-husky).

We're now going to use some ES6 syntax, which is a great improvement over the "old" ES5 syntax. All browsers and JS environments understand ES5 well, but not ES6. That's where a tool called Babel comes to the rescue!

## Babel

> üí° **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)** is a compiler that transforms ES6 code (and other things like React's JSX syntax) into ES5 code. It is very modular and can be used in tons of different [environments](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/). It is by far the preferred ES5 compiler of the React community.

- Move your `index.js` into a new `src` folder. This is where you will write your ES6 code. Remove the previous `color`-related code in `index.js`, and replace it with a simple:

```js
const str = 'ES6'
console.log(`Hello ${str}`)
```

We're using a *template string* here, which is an ES6 feature that lets us inject variables directly inside the string without concatenation using `${}`. Note that template strings are created using **backquotes**.

- Run `yarn add --dev babel-cli` to install the CLI interface for Babel.

Babel CLI comes with [two executables](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/): `babel`, which compiles ES6 files into new ES5 files, and `babel-node`, which you can use to replace your call to the `node` binary and execute ES6 files directly on the fly. `babel-node` is great for development but it is heavy and not meant for production. In this chapter we are going to use `babel-node` to set up the development environment, and in the next one we'll use `babel` to build ES5 files for production.

- In `package.json`, in your `start` script, replace `node .` by `babel-node src` (`index.js` is the default file Node looks for, which is why we can omit `index.js`).

If you try to run `yarn start` now, it should print the correct output, but Babel is not actually doing anything. That's because we didn't give it any information about which transformations we want to apply. The only reason it prints the right output is because Node natively understands ES6 without Babel's help. Some browsers or older versions of Node would not be so successful though!

- Run `yarn add --dev babel-preset-env` to install a Babel preset package called `env`, which contains configurations for the most recent ECMAScript features supported by Babel.

- Create a `.babelrc` file at the root of your project, which is a JSON file for your Babel configuration. Write the following to it to make Babel use the `env` preset:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "env"
  ]
}
```

üèÅ `yarn start` should still work, but it's actually doing something now. We can't really tell if it is though, since we're using `babel-node` to interpret ES6 code on the fly. You'll soon have a proof that your ES6 code is actually transformed when you reach the [ES6 modules syntax](#the-es6-modules-syntax) section of this chapter.

## ES6

> üí° **[ES6](http://es6-features.org/)**: The most significant improvement of the JavaScript language. There are too many ES6 features to list them here but typical ES6 code uses classes with `class`, `const` and `let`, template strings, and arrow functions (`(text) => { console.log(text) }`).

### Creating an ES6 class

- Create a new file, `src/dog.js`, containing the following ES6 class:

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  bark() {
    return `Wah wah, I am ${this.name}`
  }
}

module.exports = Dog
```

It should not look surprising to you if you've done OOP in the past in any language. It's relatively recent for JavaScript though. The class is exposed to the outside world via the `module.exports` assignment.

In `src/index.js`, write the following:

```js
const Dog = require('./dog')

const toby = new Dog('Toby')

console.log(toby.bark())
```

As you can see, unlike the community-made package `color` that we used before, when we require one of our files, we use `./` in the `require()`.

üèÅ Run `yarn start` and it should print "Wah wah, I am Toby".

### The ES6 modules syntax

Here we simply replace `const Dog = require('./dog')` by `import Dog from './dog'`, which is the newer ES6 modules syntax (as opposed to "CommonJS" modules syntax). It is currently not natively supported by NodeJS, so this is your proof that Babel processes those ES6 files correctly.

In `dog.js`, we also replace `module.exports = Dog` by `export default Dog`

üèÅ `yarn start` should still print "Wah wah, I am Toby".

## ESLint

> üí° **[ESLint](http://eslint.org)** is the linter of choice for ES6 code. A linter gives you recommendations about code formatting, which enforces style consistency in your code, and code you share with your team. It's also a great way to learn about JavaScript by making mistakes that ESLint will catch.

ESLint works with *rules*, and there are [many of them](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/). Instead of configuring the rules we want for our code ourselves, we will use the config created by Airbnb. This config uses a few plugins, so we need to install those as well.

Check out Airbnb's most recent [instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) to install the config package and all its dependencies correctly. As of 2017-02-03, they recommend using the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm info eslint-config-airbnb@latest peerDependencies --json | command sed 's/[\{\},]//g ; s/: /@/g' | xargs yarn add --dev eslint-config-airbnb@latest
```

It should install everything you need and add `eslint-config-airbnb`, `eslint-plugin-import`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, and `eslint-plugin-react` to your `package.json` file automatically.

**Note**: I've replaced `npm install` by `yarn add` in this command. Also, this won't work on Windows, so take a look at the `package.json` file of this repository and just install all the ESLint-related dependencies manually using `yarn add --dev packagename@^#.#.#` with `#.#.#` being the versions given in `package.json` for each package.

- Create an `.eslintrc.json` file at the root of your project, just like we did for Babel, and write the following to it:

```json
{
  "extends": "airbnb"
}
```

We'll create an NPM/Yarn script to run ESLint. Let's install the `eslint` package to be able to use the `eslint` CLI:

- Run `yarn add --dev eslint`

Update the `scripts` of your `package.json` to include a new `test` task:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "babel-node src",
  "test": "eslint src"
},
```

Here we just tell ESLint that want to lint all JavaScript files under the `src` folder.

We will use this standard `test` task to run a chain of all the commands that validate our code, whether it's linting, type checking, or unit testing.

- Run `yarn test`, and you should see a whole bunch of errors for missing semicolons, and a warning for using `console.log()` in `index.js`. Add `/* eslint-disable no-console */` at the top of our `index.js` file to allow the use of `console` in this file.

**Note**: If you're on Windows, make sure you configure your editor and Git to use Unix LF line endings and not Windows CRLF. If your project is only used in Windows environments, you can add `"linebreak-style": [2, "windows"]` in ESLint's `rules` array (see the example below) to enforce CRLF instead.

### Semicolons

Alright, this is probably the most heated debate in the JavaScript community, let's talk about it for a minute. JavaScript has this thing called Automatic Semicolon Insertion, which allows you to write your code with or without semicolons. It really comes down to personal preference and there is no right and wrong on this topic. If you like the syntax of Python, Ruby, or Scala, you will probably enjoy omitting semicolons. If you prefer the syntax of Java, C#, or PHP, you will probably prefer using semicolons.

Most people write JavaScript with semicolons, out of habit. That was my case until I tried going semicolon-less after seeing code samples from the Redux documentation. At first it felt a bit weird, simply because I was not used to it. After just one day of writing code this way I could not see myself going back to using semicolons at all. They felt so cumbersome and unnecessary. A semicolon-less code is easier on the eyes in my opinion, and is faster to type.

I recommend reading the [ESLint documentation about semicolons](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi). As mentioned in this page, if you're going semicolon-less, there are some rather rare cases where semicolons are required. ESLint can protect you from such cases with the `no-unexpected-multiline` rule. Let's set up ESLint to safely go semicolon-less in `.eslintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "airbnb",
  "rules": {
    "semi": [2, "never"],
    "no-unexpected-multiline": 2
  }
}
```

üèÅ Run `yarn test`, and it should now pass successfully. Try adding an unnecessary semicolon somewhere to make sure the rule is set up correctly.

I am aware that some of you will want to keep using semicolons, which will make the code provided in this tutorial inconvenient. If you are using this tutorial just for learning, I'm sure it will remain bearable to learn without semicolons, until going back to using them on your real projects. If you want to use the code provided in this tutorial as a boilerplate though, it will require a bit of rewriting, which should be pretty quick with ESLint set to enforce semicolons to guide you through the process. I apologize if you're in such case.

### Compat

[Compat](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-compat) is a neat ESLint plugin that warns you if you use some JavaScript APIs that are not available in the browsers you need to support. It uses [Browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist), which relies on [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/).

- Run `yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-compat`

- Add the following to your `package.json`, to indicate that we want to support browsers that have more than 1% market share:

```json
"browserslist": ["> 1%"],
```

- Edit your `.eslintrc.json` file like so:

```json
{
  "extends": "airbnb",
  "plugins": [
    "compat"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "semi": [2, "never"],
    "no-unexpected-multiline": 2,
    "compat/compat": 2
  }
}
```

You can try the plugin by using `navigator.serviceWorker` or `fetch` in your code for instance, which should raise an ESLint warning.

### ESLint in your editor

This chapter set you up with ESLint in the terminal, which is great for catching errors at build time / before pushing, but you also probably want it integrated to your IDE for immediate feedback. Do NOT use your IDE's native ES6 linting. Configure it so the binary it uses for linting is the one in your `node_modules` folder instead. This way it can use all of your project's config, the Airbnb preset, etc. Otherwise you will just get some generic ES6 linting.

## Flow

> üí° **[Flow](https://flowtype.org/)**: A static type checker by Facebook. It detects inconsistent types in your code. For instance, it will give you an error if you try to use a string where should be using a number.

Right now, our JavaScript code is valid ES6 code. Flow can analyze plain JavaScript to give us some insights, but in order to use its full power, we need to add type annotations in our code, which will make it non-standard. We need to teach Babel and ESLint what those type annotations are in order for these tools to not freak out when parsing our files.

- Run `yarn add --dev flow-bin babel-preset-flow babel-eslint eslint-plugin-flowtype`

`flow-bin` is the binary to run Flow in our `scripts` tasks, `babel-preset-flow` is the preset for Babel to understand Flow annotations, `babel-eslint` is a package to enable ESLint *to rely on Babel's parser* instead of its own, and `eslint-plugin-flowtype` is an ESLint plugin to lint Flow annotations. Phew.

- Update your `.babelrc` file like so:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "env",
    "flow"
  ]
}
```

- And update `.eslintrc.json` as well:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "airbnb",
    "plugin:flowtype/recommended"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "flowtype",
    "compat"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "semi": [2, "never"],
    "no-unexpected-multiline": 2,
    "compat/compat": 2
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `plugin:flowtype/recommended` contains the instruction for ESLint to use Babel's parser. If you want to be more explicit, feel free to add `"parser": "babel-eslint"` in `.eslintrc.json`.

I know this is a lot to take in, so take a minute to think about it. I'm still amazed that it is even possible for ESLint to use Babel's parser to understand Flow annotations. These 2 tools are really incredible for being so modular.

- Chain `flow` to your `test` task:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "babel-node src",
  "test": "eslint src && flow"
},
```

- Create a `.flowconfig` file at the root of your project containing:

```flowconfig
[options]
suppress_comment= \\(.\\|\n\\)*\\flow-disable-next-line
```

This is a little utility that we set up to make Flow ignore any warning detected on the next line. You would use it like this, similarly to `eslint-disable`:

```js
// flow-disable-next-line
something.flow(doesnt.like).for.instance()
```

Alright, we should be all set for the configuration part.

- Add Flow annotations to `src/dog.js` like so:

```js
// @flow

class Dog {
  name: string

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name
  }

  bark() {
    return `Wah wah, I am ${this.name}`
  }
}

export default Dog
```

The `// @flow` comment tells Flow that we want this file to be type-checked. For the rest, Flow annotations are typically a colon after a function parameter or a function name. Check out the [documentation](https://flowtype.org/docs/quick-reference.html) for more details.

- Add `// @flow` at the top of `index.js` as well.

`yarn test` should now both lint and type-check your code fine.

There are 2 things that I want you to try:

- In `dog.js`, replace `constructor(name: string)` by `constructor(name: number)`, and run `yarn test`. You should get a **Flow** error telling you that those types are incompatible. That means Flow is set up correctly.

- Now replace `constructor(name: string)` by `constructor(name:string)`, and run `yarn test`. You should get an **ESLint** error telling you that Flow annotations should have a space after the colon. That means the Flow plugin for ESLint is set up correctly.

üèÅ If you got the 2 different errors working, you are all set with Flow and ESLint! Remember to put the missing space back in the Flow annotation.

### Flow in your editor

Just like with ESLint, you should spend some time configuring your editor / IDE to give you immediate feedback when Flow detects issues in your code.

## Jest

> üí° **[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)**: A JavaScript testing library by Facebook. It is very simple to set up and provides everything you would need from a testing library right out of the box. It can also test React components.

- Run `yarn add --dev jest babel-jest` to install Jest and the package to make it use Babel.

- Add the following to your `.eslintrc.json` at the root of the object to allow the use of Jest's functions without having to import them in every test file:

```json
"env": {
  "jest": true
}
```

- Create a `src/dog.test.js` file containing:

```js
import Dog from './dog'

test('Dog.bark', () => {
  const testDog = new Dog('Test')
  expect(testDog.bark()).toBe('Wah wah, I am Test')
})
```

- Add `jest` to your `test` script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "babel-node src",
  "test": "eslint src && flow && jest --coverage"
},
```

The `--coverage` flag makes Jest generate coverage data for your tests automatically. This is useful to see which parts of your codebase lack testing. It writes this data into a `coverage` folder.

- Add `/coverage/` to your `.gitignore`

üèÅ Run `yarn test`. After linting and type checking, it should run Jest tests and show a coverage table. Everything should be green!

## Git Hooks with Husky

> üí° **[Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)**: Scripts that are run when certain actions like a commit or a push occur.

Okay so we now have this neat `test` task that tells us if our code looks good or not. We're going to set up Git Hooks to automatically run this task before every `git commit` and `git push`, which will prevent us from pushing bad code to the repository if it doesn't pass the `test` task.

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is a package that makes this very easy to set up Git Hooks.

- Run `yarn add --dev husky`

All we have to do is to create two new tasks in `scripts`, `precommit` and `prepush`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "babel-node src",
  "test": "eslint src && flow && jest --coverage",
  "precommit": "yarn test",
  "prepush": "yarn test"
},
```

üèÅ If you now try to commit or push your code, it should automatically run the `test` task.

If it does not work, it is possible that `yarn add --dev husky` did not install the Git Hooks properly. I never encountered this issue but it happens for some people. If that's your case, run `yarn add --dev husky --force`, and maybe post a note describing your situation in [this issue](https://github.com/typicode/husky/issues/84).

**Note**: If you are pushing right after a commit, you can use `git push --no-verify` to avoid running all the tests again.

Next section: [03 - Express, Nodemon, PM2](03-express-nodemon-pm2.md#readme)

Back to the [previous section](01-node-yarn-package-json.md#readme) or the [table of contents](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch#table-of-contents).

# 03 - Express, Nodemon, and PM2

Code for this chapter available [here](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-walkthrough/tree/master/03-express-nodemon-pm2).

In this section we are going to create the server that will render our web app. We will also set up a development mode and a production mode for this server.

## Express

> üí° **[Express](http://expressjs.com/)** is by far the most popular web application framework for Node. It provides a very simple and minimal API, and its features can be extended with *middleware*.

Let's set up a minimal Express server to serve an HTML page with some CSS.

- Delete everything inside `src`

Create the following files and folders:

- Create a `public/css/style.css` file containing:

```css
body {
  width: 960px;
  margin: auto;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: limegreen;
}
```

- Create an empty `src/client/` folder.

- Create an empty `src/shared/` folder.

This folder is where we put *isomorphic / universal* JavaScript code ‚Äì files that are used by both the client and the server. A great use case of shared code is *routes*, as you will see later in this tutorial when we'll make an asynchronous call. Here we simply have some configuration constants as an example for now.

- Create a `src/shared/config.js` file, containing:

```js
// @flow

export const WEB_PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000
export const STATIC_PATH = '/static'
export const APP_NAME = 'Hello App'
```

If the Node process used to run your app has a `process.env.PORT` environment variable set (that's the case when you deploy to Heroku for instance), it will use this for the port. If there is none, we default to `8000`.

- Create a `src/shared/util.js` file containing:

```js
// @flow

// eslint-disable-next-line import/prefer-default-export
export const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
```

That's a simple util to test if we are running in production mode or not. The `// eslint-disable-next-line import/prefer-default-export` comment is because we only have one named export here. You can remove it as you add other exports in this file.

- Run `yarn add express compression`

`compression` is an Express middleware to activate Gzip compression on the server.

- Create a `src/server/index.js` file containing:

```js
// @flow

import compression from 'compression'
import express from 'express'

import { APP_NAME, STATIC_PATH, WEB_PORT } from '../shared/config'
import { isProd } from '../shared/util'
import renderApp from './render-app'

const app = express()

app.use(compression())
app.use(STATIC_PATH, express.static('dist'))
app.use(STATIC_PATH, express.static('public'))

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(renderApp(APP_NAME))
})

app.listen(WEB_PORT, () => {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
  console.log(`Server running on port ${WEB_PORT} ${isProd ? '(production)' : '(development)'}.`)
})
```

Nothing fancy here, it's almost Express' Hello World tutorial with a few additional imports. We're using 2 different static file directories here. `dist` for generated files, `public` for declarative ones.

- Create a `src/server/render-app.js` file containing:

```js
// @flow

import { STATIC_PATH } from '../shared/config'

const renderApp = (title: string) =>
`<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>${title}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="${STATIC_PATH}/css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>${title}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
`

export default renderApp
```

You know how you typically have *templating engines* on the back-end? Well these are pretty much obsolete now that JavaScript supports template strings. Here we create a function that takes a `title` as a parameter and injects it in both the `title` and `h1` tags of the page, returning the complete HTML string. We also use a `STATIC_PATH` constant as the base path for all our static assets.

### HTML template strings syntax highlighting in Atom (optional)

It might be possible to get syntax highlighting working for HTML code inside template strings depending on your editor. In Atom, if you prefix your template string with an `html` tag (or any tag that *ends* with `html`, like `ilovehtml`), it will automatically highlight the content of that string. I sometimes use the `html` tag of the `common-tags` library to take advantage of this:

```js
import { html } from `common-tags`

const template = html`
<div>Wow, colors!</div>
`
```

I did not include this trick in the boilerplate of this tutorial, since it seems to only work in Atom, and it's less than ideal. Some of you Atom users might find it useful though.

Anyway, back to business!

- In `package.json` change your `start` script like so: `"start": "babel-node src/server",`

üèÅ Run `yarn start`, and hit `localhost:8000` in your browser. If everything works as expected you should see a blank page with "Hello App" written both on the tab title and as a green heading on the page.

**Note**: Some processes ‚Äì typically processes that wait for things to happen, like a server for instance ‚Äì will prevent you from entering commands in your terminal until they're done. To interrupt such processes and get your prompt back, press **Ctrl+C**. You can alternatively open a new terminal tab if you want to keep them running while being able to enter commands. You can also make these processes run in the background but that's out of the scope of this tutorial.

## Nodemon

> üí° **[Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)** is a utility to automatically restart your Node server when file changes happen in the directory.

We are going to use Nodemon whenever we are in **development** mode.

- Run `yarn add --dev nodemon`

- Change your `scripts` like so:

```json
"start": "yarn dev:start",
"dev:start": "nodemon --ignore lib --exec babel-node src/server",
```

`start` is now just a pointer to an other task, `dev:start`. That gives us a layer of abstraction to tweak what the default task is.

In `dev:start`, the `--ignore lib` flag is to *not* restart the server when changes happen in the `lib` directory. You don't have this directory yet, but we're going to generate it in the next section of this chapter, so it will soon make sense. Nodemon typically runs the `node` binary. In our case, since we're using Babel, we can tell Nodemon to use the `babel-node` binary instead. This way it will understand all the ES6/Flow code.

üèÅ Run `yarn start` and open `localhost:8000`. Go ahead and change the `APP_NAME` constant in `src/shared/config.js`, which should trigger a restart of your server in the terminal. Refresh the page to see the updated title. Note that this automatic restart of the server is different from *Hot Module Replacement*, which is when components on the page update in real-time. Here we still need a manual refresh, but at least we don't need to kill the process and restart it manually to see changes. Hot Module Replacement will be introduced in the next chapter.

## PM2

> üí° **[PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/)** is a Process Manager for Node. It keeps your processes alive in production, and offers tons of features to manage them and monitor them.

We are going to use PM2 whenever we are in **production** mode.

- Run `yarn add --dev pm2`

In production, you want your server to be as performant as possible. `babel-node` triggers the whole Babel transpilation process for your files at each execution, which is not something you want in production. We need Babel to do all this work beforehand, and have our server serve plain old pre-compiled ES5 files.

One of the main features of Babel is to take a folder of ES6 code (usually named `src`) and transpile it into a folder of ES5 code (usually named `lib`).

This `lib` folder being auto-generated, it's a good practice to clean it up before a new build, since it may contain unwanted old files. A neat simple package to delete files with cross platform support is `rimraf`.

- Run `yarn add --dev rimraf`

Let's add the following `prod:build` task to our `package.json`:

```json
"prod:build": "rimraf lib && babel src -d lib --ignore .test.js",
```

- Run `yarn prod:build`, and it should generate a `lib` folder containing the transpiled code, except for files ending in `.test.js` (note that `.test.jsx` files are also ignored by this parameter).

- Add `/lib/` to your `.gitignore`

One last thing: We are going to pass a `NODE_ENV` environment variable to our PM2 binary. With Unix, you would do this by running `NODE_ENV=production pm2`, but Windows uses a different syntax. We're going to use a small package called `cross-env` to make this syntax work on Windows as well.

- Run `yarn add --dev cross-env`

Let's update our `package.json` like so:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "yarn dev:start",
  "dev:start": "nodemon --ignore lib --exec babel-node src/server",
  "prod:build": "rimraf lib && babel src -d lib --ignore .test.js",
  "prod:start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production pm2 start lib/server && pm2 logs",
  "prod:stop": "pm2 delete server",
  "test": "eslint src && flow && jest --coverage",
  "precommit": "yarn test",
  "prepush": "yarn test"
},
```

üèÅ Run `yarn prod:build`, then run `yarn prod:start`. PM2 should show an active process. Go to `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser and you should see your app. Your terminal should show the logs, which should be "Server running on port 8000 (production).". Note that with PM2, your processes are run in the background. If you press Ctrl+C, it will kill the `pm2 logs` command, which was the last command our our `prod:start` chain, but the server should still render the page. If you want to stop the server, run `yarn prod:stop`

Now that we have a `prod:build` task, it would be neat to make sure it works fine before pushing code to the repository. Since it is probably unnecessary to run it for every commit, I suggest adding it to the `prepush` task:

```json
"prepush": "yarn test && yarn prod:build"
```

üèÅ Run `yarn prepush` or just push your files to trigger the process.

**Note**: We don't have any test here, so Jest will complain a bit. Ignore it for now.

# 04 - Webpack, React, and Hot Module Replacement

Code for this chapter available [here](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-walkthrough/tree/master/04-webpack-react-hmr).

## Webpack

> üí° **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** is a *module bundler*. It takes a whole bunch of various source files, processes them, and assembles them into one (usually) JavaScript file called a bundle, which is the only file your client will execute.

Let's create some very basic *hello world* and bundle it with Webpack.

- In `src/shared/config.js`, add the following constants:

```js
export const WDS_PORT = 7000

export const APP_CONTAINER_CLASS = 'js-app'
export const APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR = `.${APP_CONTAINER_CLASS}`
```

- Create an `src/client/index.js` file containing:

```js
import 'babel-polyfill'

import { APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR } from '../shared/config'

document.querySelector(APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR).innerHTML = '<h1>Hello Webpack!</h1>'
```

If you want to use some of the most recent ES features in your client code, like `Promise`s, you need to include the [Babel Polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) before anything else in your bundle.

- Run `yarn add babel-polyfill`

If you run ESLint on this file, it will complain about `document` being undefined.

- Add the following to `env` in your `.eslintrc.json` to allow the use of `window` and `document`:

```json
"env": {
  "browser": true,
  "jest": true
}
```

Alright, we now need to bundle this ES6 client app into an ES5 bundle.

- Create a `webpack.config.babel.js` file containing:

```js
// @flow

import path from 'path'

import { WDS_PORT } from './src/shared/config'
import { isProd } from './src/shared/util'

export default {
  entry: [
    './src/client',
  ],
  output: {
    filename: 'js/bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    publicPath: isProd ? '/static/' : `http://localhost:${WDS_PORT}/dist/`,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.(js|jsx)$/, use: 'babel-loader', exclude: /node_modules/ },
    ],
  },
  devtool: isProd ? false : 'source-map',
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
  },
  devServer: {
    port: WDS_PORT,
  },
}
```

This file is used to describe how our bundle should be assembled: `entry` is the starting point of our app, `output.filename` is the name of the bundle to generate, `output.path` and `output.publicPath` describe the destination folder and URL. We put the bundle in a `dist` folder, which will contain things that are generated automatically (unlike the declarative CSS we created earlier which lives in `public`). `module.rules` is where you tell Webpack to apply some treatment to some type of files. Here we say that we want all `.js` and `.jsx` (for React) files except the ones in `node_modules` to go through something called `babel-loader`. We also want these two extensions to be used to `resolve` modules when we `import` them. Finally, we declare a port for Webpack Dev Server.

**Note**: The `.babel.js` extension is a Webpack feature to apply our Babel transformations to this config file.

`babel-loader` is a plugin for Webpack that transpiles your code just like we've been doing since the beginning of this tutorial. The only difference is that this time, the code will end up running in the browser instead of your server.

- Run `yarn add --dev webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader`

`babel-core` is a peer-dependency of `babel-loader`, so we installed it as well.

- Add `/dist/` to your `.gitignore`

### Tasks update

In development mode, we are going to use `webpack-dev-server` to take advantage of Hot Module Reloading (later in this chapter), and in production we'll simply use `webpack` to generate bundles. In both cases, the `--progress` flag is useful to display additional information when Webpack is compiling your files. In production, we'll also pass the `-p` flag to `webpack` to minify our code, and the `NODE_ENV` variable set to `production`.

Let's update our `scripts` to implement all this, and improve some other tasks as well:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "yarn dev:start",
  "dev:start": "nodemon -e js,jsx --ignore lib --ignore dist --exec babel-node src/server",
  "dev:wds": "webpack-dev-server --progress",
  "prod:build": "rimraf lib dist && babel src -d lib --ignore .test.js && cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack -p --progress",
  "prod:start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production pm2 start lib/server && pm2 logs",
  "prod:stop": "pm2 delete server",
  "lint": "eslint src webpack.config.babel.js --ext .js,.jsx",
  "test": "yarn lint && flow && jest --coverage",
  "precommit": "yarn test",
  "prepush": "yarn test && yarn prod:build"
},
```

In `dev:start` we explicitly declare file extensions to monitor, `.js` and `.jsx`, and add `dist` in the ignored directories.

We created a separate `lint` task and added `webpack.config.babel.js` to the files to lint.

- Next, let's create the container for our app in `src/server/render-app.js`, and include the bundle that will be generated:

```js
// @flow

import { APP_CONTAINER_CLASS, STATIC_PATH, WDS_PORT } from '../shared/config'
import { isProd } from '../shared/util'

const renderApp = (title: string) =>
`<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>${title}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="${STATIC_PATH}/css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="${APP_CONTAINER_CLASS}"></div>
    <script src="${isProd ? STATIC_PATH : `http://localhost:${WDS_PORT}/dist`}/js/bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
`

export default renderApp
```

Depending on the environment we're in, we'll include either the Webpack Dev Server bundle, or the production bundle. Note that the path to Webpack Dev Server's bundle is *virtual*, `dist/js/bundle.js` is not actually read from your hard drive in development mode. It's also necessary to give Webpack Dev Server a different port than your main web port.

- Finally, in `src/server/index.js`, tweak your `console.log` message like so:

```js
console.log(`Server running on port ${WEB_PORT} ${isProd ? '(production)' :
  '(development).\nKeep "yarn dev:wds" running in an other terminal'}.`)
```

That will give other developers a hint about what to do if they try to just run `yarn start` without Webpack Dev Server.

Alright that was a lot of changes, let's see if everything works as expected:

üèÅ Run `yarn start` in a terminal. Open an other terminal tab or window, and run `yarn dev:wds` in it. Once Webpack Dev Server is done generating the bundle and its sourcemaps (which should both be ~600kB files) and both processes hang in your terminals, open `http://localhost:8000/` and you should see "Hello Webpack!". Open your Chrome console, and under the Source tab, check which files are included. You should only see `static/css/style.css` under `localhost:8000/`, and have all your ES6 source files under `webpack://./src`. That means sourcemaps are working. In your editor, in `src/client/index.js`, try changing `Hello Webpack!` into any other string. As you save the file, Webpack Dev Server in your terminal should generate a new bundle and the Chrome tab should reload automatically.

- Kill the previous processes in your terminals with Ctrl+C, then run `yarn prod:build`, and then `yarn prod:start`. Open `http://localhost:8000/` and you should still see "Hello Webpack!". In the Source tab of the Chrome console, you should this time find `static/js/bundle.js` under `localhost:8000/`, but no `webpack://` sources. Click on `bundle.js` to make sure it is minified. Run `yarn prod:stop`.

Good job, I know this was quite dense. You deserve a break! The next section is easier.

**Note**: I would recommend to have at least 3 terminals open, one for your Express server, one for the Webpack Dev Server, and one for Git, tests, and general commands like installing packages with `yarn`. Ideally, you should split your terminal screen in multiple panes to see them all.

## React

> üí° **[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)** is a library for building user interfaces by Facebook. It uses the **[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)** syntax to represent HTML elements and components while leveraging the power of JavaScript.

In this section we are going to render some text using React and JSX.

First, let's install React and ReactDOM:

- Run `yarn add react react-dom`

Rename your `src/client/index.js` file into `src/client/index.jsx` and write some React code in it:

```js
// @flow

import 'babel-polyfill'

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import App from './app'
import { APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR } from '../shared/config'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector(APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR))
```

- Create a `src/client/app.jsx` file containing:

```js
// @flow

import React from 'react'

const App = () => <h1>Hello React!</h1>

export default App
```

Since we use the JSX syntax here, we have to tell Babel that it needs to transform it with the `babel-preset-react` preset. And while we're at it, we're also going to add a Babel plugin called `flow-react-proptypes` which automatically generates PropTypes from Flow annotations for your React components.

- Run `yarn add --dev babel-preset-react babel-plugin-flow-react-proptypes` and edit your `.babelrc` file like so:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "env",
    "flow",
    "react"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "flow-react-proptypes"
  ]
}
```

üèÅ Run `yarn start` and `yarn dev:wds` and hit `http://localhost:8000`. You should see "Hello React!".

Now try changing the text in `src/client/app.jsx` to something else. Webpack Dev Server should reload the page automatically, which is pretty neat, but we are going to make it even better.

## Hot Module Replacement

> üí° **[Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/)** (*HMR*) is a powerful Webpack feature to replace a module on the fly without reloading the entire page.

To make HMR work with React, we are going to need to tweak a few things.

- Run `yarn add react-hot-loader@next`

- Edit your `webpack.config.babel.js` like so:

```js
import webpack from 'webpack'
// [...]
entry: [
  'react-hot-loader/patch',
  './src/client',
],
// [...]
devServer: {
  port: WDS_PORT,
  hot: true,
},
plugins: [
  new webpack.optimize.OccurrenceOrderPlugin(),
  new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
  new webpack.NamedModulesPlugin(),
  new webpack.NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin(),
],
```

- Edit your `src/client/index.jsx` file:

```js
// @flow

import 'babel-polyfill'

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader'

import App from './app'
import { APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR } from '../shared/config'

const rootEl = document.querySelector(APP_CONTAINER_SELECTOR)

const wrapApp = AppComponent =>
  <AppContainer>
    <AppComponent />
  </AppContainer>

ReactDOM.render(wrapApp(App), rootEl)

if (module.hot) {
  // flow-disable-next-line
  module.hot.accept('./app', () => {
    // eslint-disable-next-line global-require
    const NextApp = require('./app').default
    ReactDOM.render(wrapApp(NextApp), rootEl)
  })
}
```

We need to make our `App` a child of `react-hot-loader`'s `AppContainer`, and we need to `require` the next version of our `App` when hot-reloading. To make this  process clean and DRY, we create a little `wrapApp` function that we use in both places it needs to render `App`. Feel free to move the `eslint-disable global-require` to the top of the file to make this more readable.

üèÅ Restart your `yarn dev:wds` process if it was still running. Open `localhost:8000`. In the Console tab, you should see some logs about HMR. Go ahead and change something in `src/client/app.jsx` and your changes should be reflected in your browser after a few seconds, without any full-page reload!
